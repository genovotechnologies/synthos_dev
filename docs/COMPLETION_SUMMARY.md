## 🛠️ How to Run the Complete System

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Make executable (already done)
chmod +x start_synthos.sh

# Start both backend and frontend
./start_synthos.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Startup

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # If using virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Production Deployment

**Railway (Recommended):**
```bash
# Backend deploys automatically from Railway
# Frontend can be deployed to Vercel or Railway

# Or use the provided deployment scripts
./deploy-railway.sh
```
